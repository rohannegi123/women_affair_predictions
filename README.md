# women_affair_predictions
# The model will be used to predict did the woman have at least one affair?

* I decided to treat this as a classification problem by creating a new binary variable affair (did the woman have at least one affair?) and trying to predict the classification for each woman.

# dataset
* The dataset I chose is the affairs dataset that comes with Statsmodels. It was derived from a survey of women in 1974 by Redbook magazine, in which married women were asked about their participation in extramarital affairs. More information about the study is available in a 1978 paper from the Journal of Political Economy.
